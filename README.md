## Overview

### Intro

Hello! This is my solution to the [Planets fact site challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f) by Frontend Mentor. This project was built using **React JS** and leverages the power of **styled-components** for styling. While working on this project, I explored and learned more about using styled-components efficiently to manage CSS within React components.

### The challenge

> Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
> If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.
>
> Your users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- Anime.js
- SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- CSS Grid

### What I Learned

This project was a super cool learning experience for me! It was my first time diving into ReactJS for building dynamic user interfaces, and I had a blast exploring all the possibilities it offers. Anime.js was totally new to me tooâ€”I got to add some awesome animations to my project using timelines and easing functions. Plus, styled-components was a game-changer for managing styles right inside my React components, which made everything feel more organized and modern. I loved working with these technologies and can't wait to use them more in future projects

### Features

- Developed using ReactJS to create a modular and maintainable application structure.
- Leveraged styled-components to encapsulate CSS within individual components, providing a more manageable styling approach.
- Incorporated Anime.js for animations to enhance the user interface and provide engaging interactions.
- Utilized SASS/SCSS for enhanced styling capabilities and modularity.
